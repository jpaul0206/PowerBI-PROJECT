I developed an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to analyze survey data from data professionals, focusing on key metrics such as salaries, job roles, and programming language preferences. The project involved importing and cleaning raw data using Power BI's transformation tools, splitting and standardizing columns, and creating a more usable dataset with DAX functions. I designed various visualizations like bar charts, treemaps, gauges, and donut charts to display insights on job title salaries, favorite programming languages, and work-life balance. The project also included dashboard formatting, title adjustments, filter customizations, and theme styling for a clear and visually appealing user experience.
